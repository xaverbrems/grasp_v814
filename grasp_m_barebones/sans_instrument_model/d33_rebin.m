function binned_array = d33_rebin(array,bin_edges)
%array is a n x 3 array.  Data is re binned relative to the first column. Second column is value, Third column is error in value
%bin_edges is a list of the bin edges. There are bin_edges - 1 bins in total.

%NOTE:  20 March 2007.  This much simplified version of rebin is the raw,
%correct but slower version.  It replaces the version by Omar which
%included some tricks in splitting up the 'array' matrix in order to make
%the rebinning of large arrays much (>x10) faster, e.g. D16 data and now
%useful for multi-frame TOF data.  
%Problems came to light during Bob's analysis of small sectors over Bragg
%peaks.  When opening the sector further in any, overlapping points did not
%agree. This simple version of rebin is formally correct and does not show
%such errors.
%Probably will need to work on a new faster rebin routine using similar tricks
%to split the matricies into smaller pieces.
